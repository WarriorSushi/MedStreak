# MedStreak App Development Progress

## Session: June 3, 2025

### UI and Build Fixes Summary

#### 1. Theme Enhancements
- Fixed CardTheme compatibility issues in `app_theme.dart`
- Improved light theme with better card styling, button animations, text contrast, and input decorations
- Enhanced dark theme with similar improvements for visual consistency
- Added gradient color lists for primary, secondary, error, and success states
- Added snackbar theming for better visual feedback
- Increased contrast for better visibility and accessibility

#### 2. Navigation Fixes
- Fixed onboarding screen navigation to prevent "You have popped the last page off of the stack" error
- Updated the `_goToLogin()` method in `onboarding_screen.dart` with more robust navigation handling
- Added fallback navigation mechanisms if GoRouter fails
- Removed unused import for LoginScreen

#### 3. Logo Animation Improvements
- Replaced static logo with Lottie animation in splash screen and login screen
- Updated to use cleaner `logoanimation.json` for better visual appeal
- Configured animation parameters (fit, repeat, size) for optimal display
- Added proper animation timing controls

#### 4. Build and Gradle Fixes
- Fixed Gradle Kotlin DSL issues in root `build.gradle.kts`
- Resolved project evaluation conflicts by properly ordering configuration blocks
- Updated minSdk from 21 to 23 to meet Firebase Auth compatibility requirements
- Ensured Java 11 compatibility across the entire project

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test card swipe mechanics on multiple devices
   - Verify all navigation paths work properly
   - Ensure animations run smoothly on lower-end devices

2. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Consider adding particle effects using Flame engine
   - Implement additional animations for game feedback
   - Optimize performance for lower-end devices

3. **Final Touches**
   - Review accessibility features
   - Run final performance tests
   - Prepare for release

### Technical Notes

- App uses Flutter with Riverpod, Firebase, GoRouter, Lottie, and Google Fonts
- Android build uses Gradle Kotlin DSL with Java 11 compatibility
- Minimum Android SDK version is now 23 (Android 6.0)
- Emulator used for testing: Pixel_6

# MedStreak App Development Progress

## Session: June 3, 2025 - 09:16 AM

### UI and UX Refinements

#### 1. Card Mechanics and Interaction Improvements
- Fixed issue with cards getting stuck at borders by adding automatic swipe detection after 3ms
- Removed background particles from the game screen for better visibility
- Added subtle glitter trail effects behind dragged cards for visual feedback
- Changed the game screen background to a lighter gradient with blue/cyan/teal colors

#### 2. Logo and Branding Enhancements
- Updated the MedStreak text on the menu screen to use dual colors (Med in black, Streak in dark green)
- Ensured the splash screen uses the same Lottie animation as the main menu for brand consistency
- Applied the same dual-color text treatment to the splash screen

#### 3. Navigation Improvements
- Fixed the back button issue on the main game screen by disabling it to prevent crashes
- Maintained back buttons on all other non-main screens for proper navigation

### Card Mechanics and UI Enhancements Summary

#### 1. Card Mechanics Improvements (09:03 AM)
- Reimplemented card dragging to allow multi-directional movement with angle detection
- Added velocity-based flick detection for more natural dismissal
- Implemented stronger spring physics for better snapping action when cards are released
- Added slight rotation effect when cards are dragged horizontally
- Ensured new cards always spawn at the center of the screen
- Added helper methods for angle calculation and gesture processing

#### 2. Visual Enhancements (09:03 AM)
- Created beautiful particle background effect with fireflies and stars for the game screen
- Implemented darker deep blue gradient background for normal mode
- Organized particle effects in a separate reusable widget
- Added visual feedback for card interactions

#### 3. Navigation and UI Controls (09:03 AM)
- Added back button to all screens except onboarding and main menu
- Created reusable MedStreakAppBar component for consistent navigation
- Implemented proper screen titles in the app bar

#### 4. Sound Effects (09:03 AM)
- Created sound service for managing all app sound effects
- Added sound effects for button clicks, card swipes, and animations
- Implemented sound toggle in settings screen with persistent preference storage
- Connected sound effects to card interactions (swipe, snap, correct/wrong answers)

### Previous UI and Build Fixes Summary

#### 1. Theme Enhancements
- Fixed CardTheme compatibility issues in `app_theme.dart`
- Improved light theme with better card styling, button animations, text contrast, and input decorations
- Enhanced dark theme with similar improvements for visual consistency
- Added gradient color lists for primary, secondary, error, and success states
- Added snackbar theming for better visual feedback
- Increased contrast for better visibility and accessibility

#### 2. Navigation Fixes
- Fixed onboarding screen navigation to prevent "You have popped the last page off of the stack" error
- Updated the `_goToLogin()` method in `onboarding_screen.dart` with more robust navigation handling
- Added fallback navigation mechanisms if GoRouter fails
- Removed unused import for LoginScreen

#### 3. Logo Animation Improvements
- Replaced static logo with Lottie animation in splash screen and login screen
- Updated to use cleaner `logoanimation.json` for better visual appeal
- Configured animation parameters (fit, repeat, size) for optimal display
- Added proper animation timing controls

#### 4. Build and Gradle Fixes
- Fixed Gradle Kotlin DSL issues in root `build.gradle.kts`
- Resolved project evaluation conflicts by properly ordering configuration blocks
- Updated minSdk from 21 to 23 to meet Firebase Auth compatibility requirements
- Ensured Java 11 compatibility across the entire project

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test card swipe mechanics on multiple devices
   - Verify all navigation paths work properly
   - Ensure animations run smoothly on lower-end devices

2. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Consider adding particle effects using Flame engine
   - Implement additional animations for game feedback
   - Optimize performance for lower-end devices

3. **Final Touches**
   - Review accessibility features
   - Run final performance tests
   - Prepare for release

### Technical Notes

- App uses Flutter with Riverpod, Firebase, GoRouter, Lottie, and Google Fonts
- Android build uses Gradle Kotlin DSL with Java 11 compatibility
- Minimum Android SDK version is now 23 (Android 6.0)
- Emulator used for testing: Pixel_6
